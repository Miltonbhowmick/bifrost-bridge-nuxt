					In Norse Mythology:<br />
					In Norse mythology, Bifrost, also known as the Rainbow Bridge, is a
					celestial bridge that connects the realm of Asgard, the home of the
					gods, with Midgard, the realm of humans. It is described as a
					shimmering, multicolored bridge that spans the gap between these two
					realms. Bifrost is guarded by the god Heimdall, who has the ability to
					see and hear everything that occurs across the cosmos. According to
					the myth, Bifrost will break and collapse during the events of
					Ragnarok, the final battle that leads to the destruction of the world.
